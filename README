## Usage

Enter the YouTube playlist or video URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Enter the folder to save files (or press Enter for the current directory): downloads
Do you want to download 'video' or 'audio' only? (video/audio, default is video):
What video quality do you want? (best, worst, or 1080p, 720p, etc., default is best):
What audio quality do you want? (best, 192k, 128k, etc., default is best):
```
